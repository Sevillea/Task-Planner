// Work Day Scheduler created using jQuery, JavaScript, Moment.js, HTML & CSS. 
// I will need to add a dynamic date at the top of the page to reflect the current date using moment.js. 
// Add timeblocks in hourly increments from 9am - 5pm. 
// Each timeblock will have a text entry box for the user to input a task.
// Each box will be color coded.  
// Each inputted task will save to local storage.
// Each timeblock will have an 'add event' button on the right hand side. 
// Each add event button will use event listener 'click' when the user clicks, using jQuery. 


// Moment JavaScript for  variable 'timeNow' to show present time at top of screen. 
// Need a variable for timeblocks. 
// Need a variable for current date to display at top of calender. 
// Each timeblock will need corresponding HTML for color change relative to event state (below).


// I will need a function to check each hour block to see if the calendar event is in the past, present or future
// PAs, present of future will be color coded according to what is past, what is present, what is to come. 

// I'll need HTML Bootstrap grid containers for my time and text boxes. 
// I'll need a Bootstrap save button for each time and task.
// Each row, with its own time, will have a <textarea> in HTML to house an id, placeholder, class, rows and columns to style. 

// I'll want to tailor my Bootstrap code to make the app more personable.
