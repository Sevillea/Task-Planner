// Work Day Scheduler created using jQuery, JavaScript, Moment.js, HTML & CSS. 
// Add timeblocks in hourly increments from 9am - 5pm. 
// Each timeblock will have a text entry box for the user to input a task.
// Each inputted task will save to local storage.
// Each timeblock will have an 'add event' button on the right hand side. 
// Each add event button will use event listener 'click'. 


// Moment JavaScript for  variable 'timeNow' to show present time. 
// Need a variable for timeblocks. 
// Need a variable for current date to display at top of calender. 
// Each timeblock will need corresponding HTML for color change relative to event state (below).

// I will need a function to check each hour block to see if the calendar event is in the past, present or future
